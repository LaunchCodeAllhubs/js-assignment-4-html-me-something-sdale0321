            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I love to spend free time reading and being outside! Right now, Eragon is the series I'm on; it describes the mythical adventures of a dragon rider! Anything related to physics or engineering always intrigues me. Also, if it's got wheels I'll ride it - Skateboards, longboards, motorbikes etc...I enjoy it all!  Action based anime is endlessly entertaining to me - I love how much context the fights have, you have to know a lot of the back story for every frame to make sense!</p>

            <p class="funParagraph">My interest in computer science and coding took root when building a game on Scratch during highschool. Since then Iâ€™ve been teaching myself all I can on the amazing science of using transistors and electricity to generate such amazing advances in technology, and will always contemplate these advances in wonderment.</p>
